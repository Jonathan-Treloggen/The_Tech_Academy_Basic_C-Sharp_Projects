<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
This project is an MVC web application that acts as a car insurance website.
<br>
The Website takes the user's information and calculates a quote based on business logic.
<br>
On top of that theirs an admin page that lets you view all quotes that have been issued.
<br>
<h3>21 Game</h3>
This is a Console application game of 21 that fully functional. This assignment was complex
<br>
at first but when it was completed, I had a better understanding of how it all worked.
<br>
I had a great time with this assignment.

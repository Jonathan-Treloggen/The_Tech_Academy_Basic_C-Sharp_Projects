<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
This project is an MVC web application that acts as a car insurance website.
<br>
The Website takes the user's information and calculates a quote based on business logic.
<br>
On top of that theirs an admin page that lets you view all quotes that have been issued.

This was a console application of the card game 21. I coded a multi class library that could be  
<br>
referenced in other casino games, besides 21. Was coded entirely in C#. This assignment started 
<br>
